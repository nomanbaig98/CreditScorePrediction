# Credit Score Prediction DSO17/2024-25 MUHAMMAD NOMAN BAIG

## Overview

This project utilizes machine learning to predict credit scores based on user-provided information. It's designed to evaluate the potential risk posed by lending money to consumers and to mitigate losses due to bad debt. The application is built using [Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/) and includes features such as profile selection, input sliders, and radio buttons to simulate user input.
